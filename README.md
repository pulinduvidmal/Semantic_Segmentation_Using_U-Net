# Semantic Segmentation Using U-Net

This repository contains an example project demonstrating semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a category. U-Net, a convolutional neural network, is particularly well-suited for this task.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `image segmentation.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete workflow for training a U-Net model on a dataset. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Semantic_Segmentation_Using_U-Net](https://github.com/pulinduvidmal/Semantic_Segmentation_Using_U-Net.git
   cd Semantic_Segmentation_Using_U-Net
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   
   Launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the `image segmentation.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   
   Follow the steps in the notebook to:

   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Build the U-Net model.
   - Train the model on your dataset.
   - Evaluate the model performance.

### Example Workflow

The notebook guides you through the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Define the U-Net architecture.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and metrics.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the U-Net model on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Monitor the training process using validation data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on test data.
   - Visualize the segmentation results.

### Results

After running the notebook, you will have a trained U-Net model capable of performing semantic segmentation on your dataset. The notebook includes visualization steps to help you understand the model's performance.
